# etch-a-sketch

Welcome to the Etch-A-Sketch Project! 🎨🖌️

This project is a browser-based sketchpad that mimics the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy. It was developed to practice and demonstrate essential DOM manipulation skills using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

🛠️ Project Overview

The Etch-A-Sketch project provides users with an interactive canvas to draw on by hovering their mouse over grid squares. Each interaction leaves a mark, with additional features for enhanced functionality:

Grid-based sketchpad using JavaScript-generated divs.

Random RGB colors for each hovered square.

Progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%, reaching full black after 10 interactions.

Responsive layout using CSS Flexbox.

🎯 Features

🖱️ Interactive Sketching: Draw by simply hovering over the grid.

🌈 Random Color Mode: Each square changes to a random RGB color upon interaction.

🌑 Darkening Effect: Incrementally darkens squares until they become completely black.

🔄 Reset Grid: Ability to clear and resize the grid for a fresh canvas.

🧩 Technologies Used

JavaScript: DOM manipulation and event handling.

HTML5: Structuring the canvas and layout.

CSS3: Styling and layout with Flexbox.

🧠 Skills Practiced

DOM Manipulation: Creating and modifying elements dynamically.

JavaScript Event Handling: Responding to mouse interactions.

CSS Flexbox: Arranging elements into a responsive grid.

Problem-Solving: Implementing random colors and progressive darkening.

Debugging: Utilizing browser developer tools to test and refine functionality.

Code Optimization: Refactoring and streamlining JavaScript logic.
